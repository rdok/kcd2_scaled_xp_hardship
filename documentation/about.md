> Tightens the game’s XP progression as the player's level increases, making experience points harder to come by over time. XP earnings are adjusted to increase leveling difficulty, with reductions in XP gained from actions and increases in XP needed for each level based on the player’s main level. This approach ensures a balanced early game while steadily ramping up the challenge.

## Lore: The Hard Road to Strength
For Henry, the path to growing stronger grows rougher every day. What started as an easy rise—learning from fights and cunning deeds—has turned into a brutal struggle after a harsh fall left a lingering shadow on his spirit, sapping his progress. The lively battles and bustling towns, once rich with lessons, now feel like a kingdom running thin, where every bit of skill comes harder. The more he learns, the less experience each swing or sly step brings, a burden born from that tumble. Henry fights on, but the world doesn’t make it easy.
