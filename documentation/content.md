### XP Curve
This XP curve emerged from over 300 hours of gameplay, including a full restart. During a second playthrough with a customized "Slower Leveling" mod set to 25% of normal experience, level 20 was still reached on the first map, with most skills mastered. The key observation: levels 5–10 felt challenging, but by level 10, the difficulty dropped off. To address this, the curve starts with a moderate XP reduction and then limits it to 20% or less after level 11, maintaining the challenge longer.

Lvl  6 - 10      → XP: 35  (-65%)    (Shade of Weakness)
Lvl 11 - 15      → XP: 20  (-80%)    (Blight of Vigor)
Lvl 16 - 20      → XP: 15  (-85%)    (Reign of Frail)
Lvl 21 - 25      → XP: 10  (-90%)    (Abyss of Decline)
Lvl 28 - 30      → XP:  5  (-95%)    (Fall of Might)

### How XP Reduction Works
The mod creates custom perks & buffs that are automatically swapped by the mod to reduce XP across all skills based on main level thresholds.

## Lore: The Hard Road to Strength
As Henry becomes more skilled in his chosen crafts—whether it’s the art of swordplay, the stealth of a thief, or the cunning of a diplomat—he finds that the world of Bohemia offers him less and less in return. At first, every fight, every task, and every encounter was a teacher, each one building upon the last to make him stronger and wiser. But as he masters his chosen paths, the lessons become fewer and harder to come by. It’s like how a master blacksmith, skilled in forging the finest blades, struggles to learn the ways of the apothecary or the scribe. The more Henry specializes, the less the world has to teach him in those areas, as if Bohemia itself recognizes his expertise and withholds its secrets. Yet, Henry presses on, knowing that true greatness comes not from ease but from the relentless pursuit of mastery, even when progress grows slow and demanding.
