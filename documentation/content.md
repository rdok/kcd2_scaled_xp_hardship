### XP Curve
This XP curve emerged from over 300 hours of gameplay, including a full restart. During a second playthrough with a customized "Slower Leveling" mod set to 25% of normal experience, level 20 was still reached on the first map, with most skills mastered. The key observation: levels 5–10 felt challenging, but by level 10, the difficulty dropped off. To address this, the curve starts with a moderate XP reduction and then limits it to 20% or less after level 11, maintaining the challenge longer.

## Lore: The Hard Road to Strength
For Henry, the path to growing stronger grows rougher every day. What started as an easy rise—learning from fights and cunning deeds—has turned into a brutal struggle after a harsh fall left a lingering shadow on his spirit, sapping his progress. The lively battles and bustling towns, once rich with lessons, now feel like a kingdom running thin, where every bit of skill comes harder. The more he learns, the less experience each swing or sly step brings, a burden born from that tumble. Henry fights on, but the world doesn’t make it easy.

### How XP Reduction Works

The mod creates custom perks & buffs that are automatically swapped by the mod to reduce XP across all skills based on main level thresholds.
