## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have an easier or harder version?
Share the difficulty curve you’ve got in mind, and a preset will be shared as optional mod.

### Why do skills that fall behind struggle to catch up as the main level increases?
It’s intentional, to make mastering all skills tougher as your main level rises—delaying the game becoming too easy and encouraging new archetypes on your next play throughs.

### How do I install it?
Use Steam Workshop, Vortex Mod Manager or manually extract the contents of the mod into the `{Game}\Mods` folder.

### Is the mod available on the Steam Workshop?
Yes, it's already uploaded.
