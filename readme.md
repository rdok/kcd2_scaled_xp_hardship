> Tightens the game’s XP progression as the player's level increases, making experience points harder to come by over time. XP earnings are adjusted to increase leveling difficulty, with reductions in XP gained from actions and increases in XP needed for each level based on the player’s main level. This approach ensures a balanced early game while steadily ramping up the challenge.

### XP Curve
This XP curve emerged from over 300 hours of gameplay, including a full restart. During a second playthrough with a customized "Slower Leveling" mod set to 25% of normal experience, level 20 was still reached on the first map, with most skills mastered. The key observation: levels 5–10 felt challenging, but by level 10, the difficulty dropped off. To address this, the curve starts with a moderate XP reduction and then limits it to 20% or less after level 11, maintaining the challenge longer.

Lvl  1 -  5      → XP: 50  (-50%)    (Dawn of Pain)
Lvl  6 - 10      → XP: 35  (-65%)    (Shade of Weakness)
Lvl 11 - 15      → XP: 20  (-80%)    (Blight of Vigor)
Lvl 16 - 20      → XP: 15  (-85%)    (Reign of Frail)
Lvl 21 - 25      → XP: 10  (-90%)    (Abyss of Decline)
Lvl 28 - 30      → XP:  5  (-95%)    (Fall of Might)

## Lore: The Hard Road to Strength
For Henry, the path to growing stronger grows rougher every day. What started as an easy rise—learning from fights and cunning deeds—has turned into a brutal struggle after a harsh fall left a lingering shadow on his spirit, sapping his progress. The lively battles and bustling towns, once rich with lessons, now feel like a kingdom running thin, where every bit of skill comes harder. The more he learns, the less experience each swing or sly step brings, a burden born from that tumble. Henry fights on, but the world doesn’t make it easy.

### How XP Reduction Works

The mod creates custom perks & buffs that are automatically swapped by the mod to reduce XP across all skills based on main level thresholds.
